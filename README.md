This repository explores the application of feature scaling techniques in polynomial regression models for predicting housing prices. Feature scaling plays a crucial role in preprocessing data to ensure that features are on a similar scale, leading to more stable and accurate polynomial regression models.

Key Features
- Housing Price Dataset: Utilizes a dataset containing housing features and corresponding prices for training and evaluating the polynomial regression model.
- Polynomial Regression: Implements polynomial regression algorithms to capture non-linear relationships between features and housing prices.
- Model Evaluation: Utilizes metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the performance of the polynomial regression model.
- Visualization: Includes visualizations of scaled features, polynomial curves, and model predictions for better understanding and analysis.
